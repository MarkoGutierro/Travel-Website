# Travel-Website
I created a mock travel agency website for a fake company called Big Puffin Global. The idea for Big Puffin Global was given to me by a randomly generated computer prompt. The prompt was to create a travel agency website for a decently sized travel agency based in New York City. The theme had to be light blue.

To create the website I started off with a HTML template. I found the perfect template that allowed me to save some time and not have to start from scratch.

Off of this HTML template, I customized it to my needs. For one, I changed the theming from the default to the sky blue. I also added a call to action to try and get passengers to subscribe to the airlines newsletter.

One major change I had to make from the original template was the scaling. The website looked great on computers but awful on phones. To fix this problem, I setup custom breakpoints on the website for it to scale down with.

After having finished the website I am happy with how it came out. I know Big Puffin Global is not a real company, nothing more than a money laundering scheme if it ever exists, but I believe Big Puffin Global would be satisfied with this website if it was a real company.
